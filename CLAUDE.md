# Testing

- Add unit tests when adding features.
- After file edits, make sure there is no TypeScript (`npm run typecheck`) or eslint / prettier errors (`npm run check`) or unit test failure (`npm run test`).

# Development

- After adding features, when all tests passed, stage changes and summarize change as git message.
