# Planning

- Remember to add unit tests of the feature added as a verification step.
- At the end of each feature developed, present me a git commit message style paragraph, summarizing the prompt you received and the plan executed.

# Testing

- After file edits, make sure there is no TypeScript (`npm run typecheck`) or eslint / prettier errors (`npm run check`) or unit test failure (`npm run test`).

# Development

- Add unit tests after adding every feature.
- Stage changes and summarize change as git message when finish each feature.
